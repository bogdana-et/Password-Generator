# Password-Generator

## Description

The purpose of this application is to generate a random password for the user using an array of characters,specifically symbols, numbers, lower and upper cased letters. It helps guide the user through a series of prompts and alerts. 
I found this very challenging but learned how to work on funcions at a local and global level, and this developed my logical understanding. 

## Usage

Open the link, click generate password button and follow the prompts! Link: https://bogdana-et.github.io/Password-Generator/ .
